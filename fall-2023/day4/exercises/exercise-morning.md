# Exercise SML -- Morning day 4

### Option 1: practice with the ImDB data

* Reproduce examples from the book for SML on the IMDB data (11.2, 11.3, 11.4) (check [codefrombook.py](codefrombook.py) if you do not want to type over the code)
* Play around with different options! Can you tweak the models and make them even better? Take a look back at the [slides](../../day1/day1-afternoon.pdf) where we compared different vectorizers as well!

### Option 2: practice with the data from [Vermeer](/data-vermeer/)

* Work with the file `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the folder [`data-vermeer`](/data-vermeer/) and train a classifier using this data.
* If you feel lost, you can use the following notebook for inspiration: [`potential-solution-exercise-vermeer.ipynb`](potential-solution-exercise-vermeer.ipynb)
