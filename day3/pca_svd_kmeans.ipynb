Perhaps they were \"strong in\\nthe faith?\"\\n\\n---------------------------\\n\\n[No, I don\\'t believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\\nface after Jesus\\' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn\\'t say\\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\\ndidn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\\nceremonial aspects of it).\\n\\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\\n7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\\nhave to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent rejection of the Law, and\\nhow that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn\\'t one of the\\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that\\'s not\\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an\\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\\nPaul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s clearest here, and not everyone\\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s\\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not\\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.',\n",

       "['Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of\\nthe editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine \"Morning Star\".\\n\\nHope you like it.\\n\\n    Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti\\n\\n\\n\\n    Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,\\n    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful\\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\\n\\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\\n    on\\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\\n    Eucharist.\\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father\\'s\\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\\trest  of  the\\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\\n    until\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -4-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria\\'s life.\\n\\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\\tMaria\\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti\\'s, owning\\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\\n    did the Holy Will of God.\\n\\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\\ttwice\\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro\\'s\\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\\tlived\\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\\n\\n\\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\\n    handkerchief,\"  as\\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\\n    him she wouldn\\'t go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\\ttouch\\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\\n    held the knife over Maria\\'s chest, who was now on the floor.\\n\\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\\t\"No I\\n    will  not,\\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\\n    knife  into   Maria\\'s  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\\n    of the baby Teresa\\ton  the  landing  brought  the\\tattention  to\\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\\n\\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\\taway.\\n    As\\tthe  ambulance\\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\\n    Communion\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\\n    in\\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\\n    died at about three o\\'clock.\\n\\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria\\'s  death  but\\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God\\'s par-\\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\\n    in\\tMaria\\'s  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter\\'s canonisation.\\n\\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\\tus  to\\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\\n\\n\\n    by Brendan Arthur\\n',\n",
       " '\\nA question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a\\nphilosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything\\nevil done in its name?  You\\'re missing a central teaching of Christianity -\\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, \\'Lord, Lord,\\' will\\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\\n\\n\\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal\\ncrossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What\\nhistorical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis-\\ncredit it as well as the Bible has?\\n\\n\\nWell, it\\'s really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you\\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s\\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\\nsome people it did comprise their life\\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.

He supports his claim in several ways.   \\nThe Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  \\nWHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.

       " '[With Frank\\'s permission, I have added some information here (and in\\none case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify\\nthe historical relationship of the views.  My comments are based\\nprimarily on William Rusch\\'s historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\\nControversy\", Fortress.  I\\'m going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\\n\\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\\n \\n[SECOND CENTURY\\n\\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\\nThus Jesus\\' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\\n\\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus\\' views should\\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\\n\\n\\nTHIRD CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nDynamic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Theodotus\\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\\nconsubstantial with the Father\\'s divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\\nsense of the word.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\\n\\'diversity\\' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\\na hypostatic union.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\\nwithout beginning or end.\\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\\ndoctrine of salvation.\\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\\nChurch.  --clh]\\n\\n \\nModalistic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Praxeas\\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\\n(Jesus Only)\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God\\'s modalistic manifesting\\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\\nthe only unique and unitary God\\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\\nregeneration and sanctification.\\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ\\'s baptism.\\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\\n \\n[I\\'ve moved the following description to be with the other\\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\\n\\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\\n\\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\\nthrough the Son.  Origen\\'s intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\\n\\n\\nFOURTH CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\\n \\nSource: Arius\\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and several other lesser known\\ncults\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The inherent oneness of God\\'s nature is properly\\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\\nhe is not of the divine essence.\\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.

As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\\nthe divine essence and function.\\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen\\'s thought a bit\\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen\\'s, and it was hard\\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.

Remember\\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\\nsomething.\\n\\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\\noil.

Perhaps they were \"strong in\\nthe faith?\"\\n\\n---------------------------\\n\\n[No, I don\\'t believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\\nface after Jesus\\' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn\\'t say\\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\\ndidn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\\nceremonial aspects of it).\\n\\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\\n7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\\nhave to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent rejection of the Law, and\\nhow that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn\\'t one of the\\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that\\'s not\\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an\\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\\nPaul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s clearest here, and not everyone\\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s\\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not\\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.',\n",
