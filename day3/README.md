# Wednesday: Unsupervised Machine Learning

Today, we will discuss several unsupervised approaches to text analysis, to support so-called bottom-up of inductive types of analysis. An important characteristic of this type of analysis is that labels or measurements for the dependent variable are not available.

Morning:
- Exploratory data analysis
- clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques

Afternoon:
- Topic Modelling
