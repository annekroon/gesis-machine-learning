# Challenge: Who makes the best classifier?

1. Form teams.

2. Download the data from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4mapojr85a6sc76/AABYMkjLVG-HhueAgd0qM9kwa?dl=0 .

3. The data contain one column with tweets (their text only) and a column with a label (Abusive, Hateful, Normal, Spam). Calculate some descriptives (e.g., distribution of labels; most frequent words per label etc.)

4. Create machine learning classifiers to (a) identify spam; and (b) identify abusive and/or hateful tweets.

The team with the best classification pipeline wins!
