# Exercise SML


1. Reproduce examples from the book for SML on the IMDB data (11.2, 11.3, 11.4) (check codefrombook.py if you do not want to type over the code)
2. Play around with different options! Can you tweak the models and make them even better? Take a look back at week 7 when we compared dierent vectorizers as well!


Additional optional exercise: 
3. Download the file `train.csv` and `test.csv` from Ilias (Data from Vermeer et al., 2020) and train a classifier on them as well.
