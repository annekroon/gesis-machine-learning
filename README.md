# Course description

The course will provide insights into the concepts, challenges and opportunities associated with data so large that traditional research methods (like manual coding) cannot be applied anymore and traditional inferential statistics start to lose their meaning. Participants are introduced to strategies and techniques for capturing and analyzing digital data in communication contexts using Python. The course offers hands-on instructions regarding the several stages of computer-aided content analysis. More in particular, students will be familiarized with preprocessing methods, analysis strategies and the visualization and presentation of findings. The focus will be in particular on Machine Learning techniques to analyze quantitative textual data, amongst which both deductive (e.g., supervised) machine learning and inductive (e.g., unsupervised machine learning) approaches will be discussed.
